                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    <span id="profile" class="img"></span>
                    I've been fascinated by technology since childhood, but it was not until after graduating from UCLA with a degree in History
                    when I made up my mind about getting into the tech industry. While at my first full-time job at a small
                    web marketing company, I taught myself basic coding with HTML/CSS and jQuery, along with a hint of PHP
                    enough for creating templates in Wordpress and Joomla.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I eventually transitioned into a full-time technical project manager role. I wanted to make sure I can utilize my full potential,
                    so I took some courses in project management at the UCLA extension and obtained Professional Scrum Master
                    and PMP licenses. Being a perpetual learner, I jumped into the full-stack web development bootcamp afterwards.
                    I always wanted to have the ability to code fully functional web applications end-to-end. This is not
                    only so that I can pursue my own entrepreneurial ideas, but also to be able better oversee technical
                    aspects of web projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I try to follow a balanced path in life. In the long run, relaxation and fun activities prevent one from burning out and
                    help in staying focused. In spare time I enjoy hiking, climbing, writing music and playing chess.
                </p>
